            <p>hi, im cat and i do things and stuff. eventually i want to make this an actual, useful landing page for people interested in me and what i do. unfortunately, im very scatterbrained and not very organised! as a result, this is just one of myriad ongoing projects that i constantly try to chip away at, to varying degrees of success.</p>
