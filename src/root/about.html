<h1>Hi, I'm Cat</h1>

<div class="text-panel">

<p>
I am an engineer and artist at the intersection of humans and technology.
</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p>
In my day job I find novel uses for interactive, immersive and games technology for training and simulation.
I am passionate about free and open source software, and the importance of developing technologies that serve everyone.
</p>

<p>
I tinker for fun and make things when I can, inspired by physics, the universe and boundaries. I am currently most enamoured by optics, orbital mechanics and relativity.
</p>

<p>
Besides computing, I like caring for my plants, photography, and studying language, culture and philosophy. I take an interest in fashion, makeup and self-presentation, and regularly go to see live music.

<p>
By day I work with hardware, software and people finding useful things to do with immersive technology.
For professional inquiries, please find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cat-flynn-08751611b/">LinkedIn</a>.

<p>
By night, I create.
Often it's <a href="https://ktyl.itch.io/">games</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ktyldev/">code</a>, but I am also interested in photography, writing, drawing, and making music.
This website is to share those things.
I'm working on building it out at the moment, so for now please just enjoy some things I've made in the <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a>!
